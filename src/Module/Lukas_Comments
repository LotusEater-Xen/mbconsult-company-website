To comment on the folder Module:

Module/modules is the folder where I store the react components that I am using. 
So navbars, heroes etc.
(most of these are ripped from the daisy ui extension)

My idea is to create folders for the individual pages on which i use these components.
This allows me to copy paste them and adjust them, without modifying the blueprint so 
I can use it for other pages aswell
