To comment on Seiten/Pages:

Here is where I store the Pages meaning the ones that I have references to in the module app.js
App.js contains the Router that allows navigation between the different pages.

There is not much going on here exactly. I have not yet need to write special js scripts for a page,
so most of the pages are just rendering components from the "Module" Directory.
